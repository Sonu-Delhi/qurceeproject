            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Qurcee Furniture was founded by Sonu Yadav, a passionate designer with a vision to transform
              homes through beautifully crafted furniture. With over a decade of experience in furniture design 
              and interior decoration, Sonu Yadav believes in creating pieces that not only elevate spaces 
              but also make them more functional and comfortable for everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Growing up with a love for design, Sonu Yadav pursued formal education in interior design 
              and furniture craftsmanship. This passion led to the creation of Qurcee Furniture, where each 
              piece is made with attention to detail, quality materials, and a deep understanding of modern aesthetics.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              [Owner's Name] believes that furniture should be more than just functionalâ€”it should be an expression 
              of who we are. By blending contemporary styles with traditional craftsmanship, Qurcee Furniture 
              offers unique and customizable pieces that can transform any space into a personal sanctuary.
